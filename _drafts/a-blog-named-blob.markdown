**blog?** A couple of weeks ago, following the death of Parse.com, I wrote a rant about the virtues of portability and how they are too often overlooked. Posting that rant on a system that is not inherently portable (facebook, medium, etc.) felt a bit wrong. So, following a New Year's resolution to better document my work, a blog seemed in order. 

**blob?** Developers' blog usually have a wise ass name. My blob is no different.
